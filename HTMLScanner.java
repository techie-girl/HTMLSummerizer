import java.util.Scanner;

/* This is a simple HTML Scanner that breaks up HTML into tags.  
 * It's main function is to extract the tag names from an HTML document.
 * For example, given the tags 
 *    <a href="http://www.cs.dal.ca"> Computer Science </a>
 * it will return the tags "a" and "/a"
 * The scanner discards everything but the tag names.
 * The scanner provides a constructor and two methods:
 *  HTMLScanner( Scanner s ) : takes a regular Scanner object, and parses its
 *                             contents
 *  boolean hasNextTag()     : returns true if and only if a tag is available
 *  String nextTag()         : returns the name of the next tag
 *
 * As a convenience, the class also provides a list of all the void or null
 * tags, which are tags that do not need to be closed.
